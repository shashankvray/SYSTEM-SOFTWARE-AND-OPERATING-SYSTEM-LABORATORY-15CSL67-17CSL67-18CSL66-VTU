1.a) Write a LEX program to recognize valid arithmetic expression. Identifiers in the expression could be only integers and operators could be + and *. Count the identifiers & operators present and print them separately.  
  b) Write YACC program to evaluate arithmetic expression involving operators:  +, -, *, and / 

2. Develop, Implement and Execute a program using YACC tool to recognize all strings ending with b preceded by n  a’s  using the grammar  an  b  (note: input n value) 

3. Design, develop and implement YACC/C program to construct Predictive / LL(1) Parsing Table for the grammar rules: A → aBa , B → bB | ε . Use this table to parse the sentence: abba$ 

4. Design, develop and implement YACC/C program to demonstrate Shift Reduce Parsing technique for the grammar rules: E → E+T | T, T → T*F | F, F → (E) | id  and parse the sentence: id + id * id.  

5. Design, develop and implement a C/Java program to generate the machine code using Triples for the statement A = -B * (C + D) whose intermediate code in three-address form:  T1 = -B , T2 = C + D , T3 = T1 + T2 , A = T3 

6. a) Write a LEX program to eliminate comment lines in a C program and copy the resulting program into a separate file.  
   b) Write YACC program to recognize valid identifier, operators and keywords in the given text (C program) file. 
   
7. Design, develop and implement a C/C++/Java program to simulate the working of Shortest remaining time and Round Robin (RR) scheduling algorithms. Experiment with different quantum sizes for RR algorithm. 

8. Design, develop and implement a C/C++/Java program to implement Banker’s algorithm. Assume suitable input required to demonstrate the results.  

9. Design, develop and implement a C/C++/Java program to implement page replacement algorithms LRU and FIFO. Assume suitable input required to demonstrate the results.
